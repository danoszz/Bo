# Bo + Speech Recogniton Web API

For a school project I've made an interactive AI bot 'Bo', who you can talk to and replies in different languages.

## Prototype

It's a prototype not a full working self learning AI, so only the animations, speech-recogniton and speech are implemented. The goal of this little project was just to get the feeling of a AI talking bot. Total time to get to this prototype was 6 hours.
